This is our Data Structure Project of Skip List in this project we have created two classes (SkipNode and SkipList). The class (SkipNode) is used to implement node. The class (SkipList) after initializing, we have given two attributes (maximum_layers and div). In attribute (maximum_layers) we define maximum number of layers for skip list, by this layers will not be more than given value and attribute (div) is the fraction of the nodes. After that we have created seven functions i.e (Create, Random_Layer, Input, Insertion, Deletion, Searching and Print). In function (Create) we have made an object of class (SkipNode) which creates new node and then returned the object. In function (Random_Layer) it creates random layers for node. The function (Input) is used in two functions i.e (Insertion and Deletion) it creates an updated array and initializes it. Now the functions (Insertion and Deletion) are used to Insert and Delete the selected element respectively. Function (Searching) is used for searching the element in skip list and the last function (Print) prints the skip list in layers.
